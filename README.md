# Hi there 👋

👨🏼‍💻 I'm a dedicated Full-Stack Software Engineer with a strong command of JavaScript technologies, including Node, Express, React, React Native, MongoDB, TypeScript. 

💻 Professionally, I strive for excellence and have experience in delivering high-quality software, even when timelines are tight. 

🎓 I'm open to learning and staying current with industry trends and technologies. I take pride in writing clean and efficient code that aims to meet and, hopefully, exceed expectations.

🎲 I’m currently working on my [CubeXpert](https://github.com/tarasovladislav/CubeXpert) project - A cutting-edge React Native app to revolutionize your cube solving experience. 

⚡ During my free time, I enjoy playing chess, board games and workout.
